# Road-Accident-Analysis-Dashboard
# Overview
Welcome to the UK Road Accident Analysis Power BI Dashboard. This project presents an in-depth analysis of road accidents that occurred in the United Kingdom during the years 2021 and 2022. The dashboard provides insights into accident trends, casualties, contributing factors, and geographical distribution.

# Features
Data Collection and Cleaning: The project began by sourcing road accident data from reputable online repositories. Rigorous data cleaning techniques were applied to address inconsistencies, including the 'fatal' and 'fetal' intermix issue within a column.

Calendar Table: A 'calendar' table was meticulously constructed to facilitate time-based analysis. This table includes columns for date, month, and year, enabling smooth segmentation and comparison of accident data.

# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
Essential KPIs were devised to quantify accident statistics for the year 2022. These KPIs encompass:
  - Year 2022 casualties
  - Year 2022 total accidents
  - Year 2022 fatal casualties
  - Year 2022 serious casualties
  - Year 2022 slight casualties
  
Additionally, each KPI is supplemented with the percentage increase or decrease in casualties compared to the previous year, providing a dynamic perspective on accident trends.

# Visualizations:
   # Pie Charts:
    - An insightful pie chart illustrating the distribution of casualties based on rural/urban areas.
    - A pie chart showcasing the distribution of casualties across different light conditions.
  # Tree Map:
    - A dynamic tree map depicting the relationship between casualties and road types, offering a
    comprehensive view of accident data.
  # Area Chart:

      preceding year.
  # Casualties by Vehicle Type:
    - A categorized list offering a breakdown of casualties by vehicle types, shedding light on 
      potential accident patterns.
  # Geographical Distribution Map:
    - A map of the United Kingdom displaying accident locations using latitude and longitude 
    coordinates, providing spatial context to the analysis.
# Wrap up
The UK Road Accident Analysis Power BI Dashboard is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of road accidents in the United Kingdom during the years 2021 and 2022. By harnessing data cleaning, visualization techniques, and dynamic KPIs, this dashboard offers insights into accident trends, casualties, and contributing factors. The inclusion of geographical distribution mapping further enhances the contextualization of the data.
